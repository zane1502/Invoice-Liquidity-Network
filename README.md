# Invoice Liquidity Network

[![CI](https://github.com/Nursca/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nursca/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Turn unpaid invoices into instant liquidity on-chain, on Stellar.**

Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) is an open-source, decentralized invoice factoring protocol built on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts. Freelancers, creators, and SMEs can unlock the value of their outstanding invoices immediately, while DeFi liquidity providers earn yield by funding them at a discount.

No banks. No credit checks. No 60-day waits.

---

## The Problem

Invoice payment delays are one of the most persistent cash flow problems for independent workers and small businesses globally:

- The average invoice payment delay is **30–90 days**
- Traditional invoice factoring companies charge **3–5% fees** and restrict access
- Most DeFi lending protocols require crypto collateral — useless for someone holding an invoice, not tokens

## The Solution

ILN creates a two-sided marketplace on Stellar:

|                 Role                  |               What they do                |                 What they get                |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Invoice holder** (freelancer / SME) | Submits an unpaid invoice to the protocol | Immediate USDC liquidity at a small discount |
| **Liquidity provider** (DeFi user)    | Funds invoices at a discount rate         | Yield when the invoice is paid in full       |

The Soroban contract acts as a trustless escrow holding funds, enforcing terms, and releasing payments automatically.

## How It Works

```
Freelancer                  ILN Contract              Liquidity Provider
    |                            |                            |
    |--- submit_invoice() ------>|                            |
    |    (amount, payer,         |                            |
    |     due_date, discount)    |                            |
    |                            |<--- fund_invoice() --------|
    |                            |    (sends USDC at          |
    |<-- receives USDC -------   |     discounted amount)     |
    |   (amount - discount)      |                            |
    |                            |                            |
   ...    invoice due date       ...                          |
    |                            |                            |
  Payer --- mark_paid() -------->|                            |
                                 |--- releases full amount -->|
                                      (LP earns the spread)
```

### Contract lifecycle

1. **Submit** — A freelancer calls `submit_invoice()` with the invoice details and a proposed discount rate
2. **Fund** — A liquidity provider calls `fund_invoice()`, sending USDC. The freelancer immediately receives `amount × (1 - discount_rate)`
3. **Pay** — The payer (client) calls `mark_paid()` or is verified off-chain, releasing the full invoice amount to the LP
4. **Earn** — The LP receives the full invoice value, earning the discount spread as yield

---

## Built on Stellar

ILN is built natively on Stellar for a reason:

- **Native USDC support** — Stellar has deep USDC liquidity via Circle, making it the ideal stablecoin rail for invoice settlements
- **Ultra-low fees** — Stellar transactions cost fractions of a cent, making micropayment invoices economically viable
- **Fast finality** — 3–5 second transaction finality means liquidity moves in near real-time
- **Soroban smart contracts** — Stellar's native smart contract platform provides the trustless escrow layer ILN needs
- **Financial inclusion focus** — Stellar's mission aligns with ILN's goal of giving underserved freelancers and SMEs access to capital

### Testnet Deployment

|      Network    |                       Contract ID                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stellar Testnet | `CD3TE3IAHM737P236XZL2OYU275ZKD6MN7YH7PYYAXYIGEH55OPEWYJC` |

> Mainnet deployment coming after audit. Do not use with real funds until then.

## JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

The repository now includes a typed SDK package at [sdk/README.md](/Users/mac/Desktop/Learning-folder/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/sdk/README.md) with browser Freighter signing support and Node.js keypair signing.

```bash
npm install @invoice-liquidity/sdk
```

## Frontend Snapshot Tests

The frontend uses Vitest snapshots for key UI states so unintentional visual changes are caught during review.

```bash
cd frontend && npm test
```

To intentionally refresh committed snapshots after a UI change:

cd frontend && npm test -- --update-snapshots
```

## End-to-End Testing (E2E)

Integration tests validate the smart contract behaviors against a local live Stellar network to ensure perfect balance assertions and lifecycle determinism.

**Prerequisites:**
You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

**Running tests locally:**
1. Start the local Stellar node:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Run the suite:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```
*If Docker is unavailable, the tests will detect unreachable nodes and gracefully skip instead of failing.*

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
E2E testing is fully integrated into GitHub Actions, but skipped by default to save CI minutes. To force CI to run the `e2e-tests` job, set the environment variable:
`RUN_E2E=true`

## Smart Contract Interface

### Data Types

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct Invoice {
    pub id: u64,
    pub freelancer: Address,
    pub payer: Address,
    pub amount: i128,          // in stroops (1 USDC = 10_000_000 stroops)
    pub due_date: u64,         // Unix timestamp
    pub discount_rate: u32,    // basis points, e.g. 300 = 3%
    pub status: InvoiceStatus,
    pub funder: Option<Address>,
}

#[contracttype]
pub enum InvoiceStatus {
    Pending,    // submitted, awaiting funding
    Funded,     // LP has funded, freelancer paid out
    Paid,       // payer has settled, LP released
    Defaulted,  // past due_date, not paid
}
```

### Functions

```rust
// Submit a new invoice to the protocol
fn submit_invoice(
    env: Env,
    freelancer: Address,
    payer: Address,
    amount: i128,
    due_date: u64,
    discount_rate: u32,
) -> u64  // returns invoice_id

// Fund an invoice as a liquidity provider
fn fund_invoice(
    env: Env,
    funder: Address,
    invoice_id: u64,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>

// Mark an invoice as paid (called by payer or authorized oracle)
fn mark_paid(
    env: Env,
    invoice_id: u64,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>

// Get invoice details
fn get_invoice(env: Env, invoice_id: u64) -> Invoice

// Claim funds after default (LP recourse mechanism)
fn claim_default(
    env: Env,
    funder: Address,
    invoice_id: u64,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

## Deployment Script
This repository includes an automated deployment script that handles the full Soroban contract lifecycle.

### Script Location
```bash
scripts/deploy.ts
```
### What it does
The script fully automates:
- Contract build using existing Makefile
- WASM artifact detection
- Deployment to Soroban testnet or mainnet
- Contract verification using get_invoice(1)
- Automatic update of:
  - .env → CONTRACT_ID
  - README.md → Contract ID field
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Structured error handling

### Usage
#### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
node scripts/deploy.ts --network=testnet
```

#### Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
node scripts/deploy.ts --network=mainnet
```
#### Dry Run (No Deployment)
```bash
node scripts/deploy.ts --dry-run
```

### Environment Setup
Ensure .env contains:
```env
STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.74+)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli) (`stellar`)
- A funded Stellar testnet wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nursca/Invoice-Liquidity-Network.git
cd invoice-liquidity-network

# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt

# Configure for testnet
stellar network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

# Generate a testnet keypair and fund it
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet
stellar keys fund alice --network testnet
```

### Development Wallet Funding

To simplify testing on Stellar Testnet, use the `fund-wallets.sh` script. This script automatically funds addresses with testnet XLM via Friendbot and mints mock USDC if an admin key is provided.

#### Environment Setup

Ensure the following environment variables are set:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Secret key of the USDC issuer/admin (required for minting) |
| `USDC_CONTRACT_ID` | Contract ID of the mock USDC on Testnet |

#### Usage

**1. Using command-line arguments:**
```bash
./scripts/fund-wallets.sh GADDRESS1... GADDRESS2...
```

**2. Using a batch file:**
Create a `dev-wallets.txt` file in the root directory with one address per line, then run:
```bash
./scripts/fund-wallets.sh
```

**3. Via Makefile:**
```bash
make seed
```

The script includes automatic retries with exponential backoff to handle rate limits and will output a summary table of balances upon completion.

### Build & Test

```bash
# Build the contract
cd contracts/invoice_liquidity
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Deploy to testnet
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/invoice_liquidity.wasm \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet
```

### Invoke the Contract

```bash
# Submit an invoice
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- submit_invoice \
  --freelancer GXXXXXXXXXX \
  --payer GXXXXXXXXXX \
  --amount 1000000000 \
  --due_date 1735689600 \
  --discount_rate 300

# Fund an invoice (as LP)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source bob \
  --network testnet \
  -- fund_invoice \
  --funder GXXXXXXXXXX \
  --invoice_id 1
```

## Risk & Limitations

ILN is experimental software. Key risks to understand:

**Default risk** — If a payer doesn't pay, the LP absorbs the loss. ILN v1 does not have an insurance mechanism. This is being addressed in [Issue #3](../../issues/3).

**Oracle trust** — `mark_paid()` currently relies on the payer calling the contract directly, or a trusted oracle. A decentralized verification layer is on the roadmap.

**No credit scoring (yet)** — All invoices are treated equally. Discount rates are set by the freelancer. LPs should assess payer quality manually for now.

**Smart contract risk** — This contract has not been audited. Do not use on mainnet with real funds until a formal audit is completed.

---

## Governance

The ILN protocol is governed by its community of token holders. To learn how governance works, how to earn voting power, and how to submit or vote on proposals, please read our [Governance Guide](./docs/governance.md).
