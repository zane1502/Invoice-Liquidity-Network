# Design System Strategy: The Fiscal Atelier

## 1. Overview & Creative North Star
**Creative North Star: "The Fiscal Atelier"**
This design system moves away from the sterile, "template-locked" feel of traditional fintech and into the realm of high-end editorial curation. We are building a digital workspace that feels like a bespoke financial atelier—where precision meets warmth.

By rejecting the "flat grid" in favor of intentional asymmetry, layered surfaces, and high-contrast typography, we communicate a brand that is both authoritative (Archer/Newsreader) and technologically advanced (Manrope/Linear-inspired clarity). This system is designed to feel "built," not "generated," using depth and tonal transitions to guide the eye without the clutter of traditional UI dividers.

## 2. Colors & Tonal Architecture
The palette is rooted in a "Warm Industrial" aesthetic. We pair the structural reliability of Navy/Slate with the organic invitation of parchment-inspired warm grays.

### The "No-Line" Rule
**Explicit Instruction:** Designers are prohibited from using 1px solid borders for sectioning or containment. 
Boundaries must be defined solely through background color shifts or subtle tonal transitions. For example, a `surface-container-low` section sitting against a `surface` background creates a clean, architectural break that feels more premium than a stroke.

### Surface Hierarchy & Nesting
Treat the UI as a series of physical layers—like stacked sheets of fine, heavy-stock paper.
- **Surface (Base):** `#fff8f3` — The canvas.
- **Surface-Container-Low:** `#fff2e3` — For subtle secondary content.
- **Surface-Container-High:** `#f6e6d3` — To pull elements toward the user.
- **Surface-Container-Highest:** `#f0e0cd` — For the most prominent interactive modules.

### Signature Textures & Glassmorphism
While the system avoids "neon" or "loud" effects, we utilize **Matte Glassmorphism** for floating elements (modals, dropdowns, navigation bars). 
- Use semi-transparent surface colors with a `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`. 
- This allows the warmth of the underlying layers to bleed through, ensuring the UI feels integrated rather than "pasted on."

## 3. Typography
The typographic system is a dialogue between "The Authority" (Serif) and "The Tool" (Sans-Serif).

| Role | Token | Font Family | Weight | Size | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Display** | `display-lg` | Newsreader (Archer Proxy) | Medium | 3.5rem | High-end editorial statements |
| **Headline**| `headline-md` | Newsreader | Regular | 1.75rem | Page section headers |
| **Title**   | `title-lg` | Manrope | Bold | 1.375rem | Component-level headers |
| **Body**    | `body-lg` | Manrope | Regular | 1rem | Long-form readability |
| **Label**   | `label-md` | Manrope | Medium | 0.75rem | Data points & UI metadata |

**Editorial Contrast:** Always pair a large Serif headline with a clean, wide-tracked Sans-Serif label (`label-md`) to create the "Stripe-grade" sophisticated hierarchy.

## 4. Elevation & Depth
In this system, elevation is an optical illusion created by light and tone, not shadows.

### The Layering Principle
Depth is achieved by "stacking" the surface tiers. To make a card feel interactive:
1. Start with a `surface-container-low` section.
2. Place a `surface-container-lowest` (#ffffff) card on top.
3. This creates a natural "lift" without a single drop shadow.

### The "Ghost Border" Fallback
If a border is strictly necessary for accessibility (WCAG AA), use a **Ghost Border**:
- Use `outline-variant` (`#c2c7ce`) at **15% opacity**.
- This provides a "suggestion" of a container without breaking the editorial flow.

## 5. Components

### Buttons (The Interaction Core)
- **Primary:** Background: `primary` (#3d627f); Text: `on-primary` (#ffffff). Corner radius: `8px`.
- **Secondary/CTA:** Background: `secondary-fixed-dim` (#a9ccdb). This "soft blue" provides contrast without the aggression of a standard "Alert" color.
- **Interaction:** On hover, do not change the color value; instead, shift the elevation using a subtle `surface-container-highest` tint.

### Cards & Modules
- **Rule:** Forbid the use of divider lines. 
- Use vertical white space (following the 8px grid) to separate content blocks. 
- Group related data using a `surface-variant` background color block rather than a box.

### Input Fields
- **Styling:** Minimalist. No bottom-line-only inputs. Use a solid `surface-container-lowest` fill with a `Ghost Border`.
- **Focus State:** Transition the border to `primary` (#3d627f) at 100% opacity.

### Signature Component: The "Liquidity Meter"
- A geometric, clean illustration component representing cash flow. Use `primary-container` (#81a6c6) for the fill and `surface-dim` for the track. Avoid round caps; use sharp, geometric terminations to maintain the modern fintech edge.

## 6. Do’s and Don’ts

### Do:
- **Do** use intentional asymmetry. A left-aligned headline with a right-aligned CTA creates a dynamic, high-end feel.
- **Do** respect the 8px spacing grid religiously to maintain "Linear-level" precision.
- **Do** use `Newsreader` for all numbers in large data displays to give them a "Financial Journal" weight.

### Don’t:
- **Don’t** use pure black (#000000) for text. Use `on-background` (#221a0f) to maintain the warmth of the palette.
- **Don’t** use "Card-in-Card" layouts with multiple borders. Use background color shifts to nest information.
- **Don’t** use standard icons. Use thick-stroke (2px), geometric icon sets that mirror the weight of the Archer/Newsreader letterforms.

## 7. Roundedness Scale
- **sm:** 4px (Selection indicators, Tooltips)
- **DEFAULT:** 8px (Buttons, Standard Cards, Inputs)
- **lg:** 16px (Main Content Containers, Hero sections)
- **full:** 9999px (Pills, Chips, Notification Badges)

By adhering to these rules, the design system will project an aura of "Trust through Precision"—ensuring the Invoice Liquidity Network feels like a generational financial institution.
