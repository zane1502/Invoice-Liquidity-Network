# Analytics Integration Guide

## Overview

ILN analytics expose indexed invoice state for dashboards, portfolio views, and risk monitoring. Integrators can read protocol totals, [LP](glossary.md#lp-liquidity-provider) performance, [freelancer](glossary.md#freelancer) activity, invoice history, and ranked LP yield without calling [Soroban](glossary.md#soroban) RPC directly.

The indexer watches ILN contract events, fetches the latest `get_invoice(id)` state from Soroban RPC, stores normalized rows in SQLite, and serves REST endpoints. The SDK analytics module wraps those endpoints with TypeScript types and a small in-memory cache.

Analytics are derived from on-chain invoice data only:

- invoice amount, [due date](glossary.md#due-date), [discount rate](glossary.md#discount-rate), lifecycle status, [freelancer](glossary.md#freelancer), [payer](glossary.md#payer), funder, and funding timestamp
- contract status transitions emitted by `submitted`, `funded`, `paid`, and `defaulted` events
- realized LP yield from paid invoices

## Metric Definitions

All monetary values are in token base units. For USDC-like assets this repo treats `10_000_000` units as `1 USDC`.

Contract formulas verified against [invoice_liquidity/src/lib.rs](../invoice-liquidity-network/contracts/invoice_liquidity/src/lib.rs) and arithmetic tests in [tests_arithmetic.rs](../invoice-liquidity-network/contracts/invoice_liquidity/src/tests_arithmetic.rs):

| Metric | Formula | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discount amount | `floor(amount * discount_rate / 10_000)` | `discount_rate` is [basis points](glossary.md#basis-points-bps). `300` means `3.00%`. |
| Freelancer payout | `amount - discount_amount` | Paid to the freelancer once an invoice becomes fully funded. |
| LP realized yield | `discount_amount` for invoices with status `Paid` | `mark_paid` transfers `amount + discount_amount` to the LP. |
| Default recovery | `discount_amount` for invoices with status `Defaulted` | `claim_default` returns only the escrowed discount to the LP; it is not counted as realized yield. |
| Protocol total volume | `sum(invoice.amount)` across indexed invoices | Includes every indexed invoice status. |
| Protocol total yield | `sum(discount_amount)` for `Paid` invoices | Excludes `Funded`, `Pending`, and `Defaulted` invoices. |
| Default rate | `defaulted_terminal_invoices / terminal_invoices` | Terminal invoices are `Paid` or `Defaulted`. Returns `0` when there are no terminal invoices. |
| LP deployed | `sum(invoice.amount)` where `invoice.funder == address` | Includes funded, paid, and defaulted invoices indexed for that LP. |
| LP invoice count | `count(invoices)` where `invoice.funder == address` | Includes all statuses with that funder. |
| LP default rate | same default-rate formula, scoped to `invoice.funder == address` | Only paid/defaulted invoices are in the denominator. |
| Freelancer submitted | `count(invoices)` where `invoice.freelancer == address` | Includes every status. |
| Freelancer funded | count where freelancer matches and status is `Funded`, `Paid`, or `Defaulted` | These statuses indicate the freelancer received funding. |
| Freelancer total received | `sum(amount - discount_amount)` for funded freelancer invoices | Based on contract funding payout. |
| Average discount | `sum(discount_rate) / submitted` | Returned in basis points; `0` when there are no invoices. |

The contract also updates [payer](glossary.md#payer) [reputation score](glossary.md#reputation-score): `mark_paid` increments score by `1`; `claim_default` subtracts `5`, floored at `0`. The public analytics API does not currently expose payer score history.

## SDK Analytics Module Reference

Import from the published SDK package:

```ts
import { AnalyticsSDK } from "@invoice-liquidity/sdk";
```

Constructor:

```ts
new AnalyticsSDK(baseUrl?: string, defaultTtl?: number)
```

`baseUrl` defaults to `https://api.iln.network`. `defaultTtl` is an in-memory cache TTL in milliseconds and defaults to `300_000` (5 minutes).

Types and methods:

```ts
interface ProtocolStats {
  totalInvoices: number;
  totalVolume: bigint;
  totalYield: bigint;
  defaultRate: number;
}

interface LPStats {
  deployed: bigint;
  yield: bigint;
  invoiceCount: number;
  defaultRate: number;
}

interface FreelancerStats {
  submitted: number;
  funded: number;
  totalReceived: bigint;
  avgDiscount: number;
}

interface AnalyticsInvoice {
  id: number;
  freelancer: string;
  payer: string;
  amount: bigint;
  due_date: number;
  discount_rate: number;
  status: string;
  funder: string | null;
}

interface LPStat {
  address: string;
  yield: bigint;
  invoiceCount: number;
}

class AnalyticsSDK {
  getProtocolStats(): Promise<ProtocolStats>;
  getLPStats(address: string): Promise<LPStats>;
  getFreelancerStats(address: string): Promise<FreelancerStats>;
  getInvoiceHistory(
    address: string,
    role: "freelancer" | "payer" | "funder"
  ): Promise<AnalyticsInvoice[]>;
  getTopLPs(limit?: number, period?: "all" | "week" | "month"): Promise<LPStat[]>;
  clearCache(): void;
}
```

The SDK converts decimal string amounts returned by the indexer into `bigint` values.

## Data Freshness

The indexer polls Soroban RPC every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`; the default is `5000` ms. Each poll processes new contract events, fetches latest invoice state via `get_invoice(id)`, and upserts local SQLite rows.

Expected freshness is:

- normal operation: approximately one poll interval plus RPC response time
- local default configuration: usually 5-10 seconds after the event appears on RPC
- SDK consumers: add up to the configured SDK cache TTL; default cache TTL is 5 minutes

Use `new AnalyticsSDK(baseUrl, 0)` or call `clearCache()` when a dashboard needs fresh reads after a known transaction.

## Example: Simple Analytics Widget

```ts
import { AnalyticsSDK } from "@invoice-liquidity/sdk";

const api = new AnalyticsSDK("http://localhost:3001", 30_000);
const usd = (units: bigint) => `$${(Number(units) / 10_000_000).toFixed(2)}`;

export async function renderAnalyticsWidget(el: HTMLElement) {
  const [stats, top] = await Promise.all([
    api.getProtocolStats(),
    api.getTopLPs(3, "all"),
  ]);

  el.innerHTML = `
    <strong>ILN analytics</strong>
    <p>${stats.totalInvoices} invoices indexed</p>
    <p>${usd(stats.totalVolume)} total volume</p>
    <p>${usd(stats.totalYield)} LP yield</p>
    <p>${(stats.defaultRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% default rate</p>
    <ol>${top.map((lp) =>
      `<li>${lp.address.slice(0, 6)}... ${usd(lp.yield)}</li>`
    ).join("")}</ol>
  `;
}
```

## Limitations

- The analytics API does not include off-chain invoice documents, payer identity checks, credit bureau data, KYC status, payment rails outside the ILN contract, or manual dispute outcomes.
- The indexer only knows events it has processed. If it starts from a later ledger, older invoices are absent until backfilled.
- Large amounts are serialized as strings over HTTP. Use `bigint` in TypeScript when doing calculations.
- Multi-funder partial funding is represented on-chain, but the current indexer invoice row stores one `funder` field for the full-funding path. Analytics that require per-contribution attribution need event-level or funder-list indexing.
- Default rate only considers terminal `Paid` and `Defaulted` invoices. Pending and funded invoices are still in flight and are excluded from that denominator.
- Yield is realized only after `mark_paid`. A defaulted invoice may return the escrowed discount, but it is not treated as yield.
