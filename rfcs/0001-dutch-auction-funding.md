# RFC 0001 — Dutch Auction Funding

- **Status:** Draft
- **Author(s):** [@Invoice-Liquidity-Network](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network)
- **Created:** 2026-06-23
- **PR:** (pending)

## Summary

Replace the current fixed-discount funding model with a Dutch auction mechanism, where the discount rate offered to liquidity providers rises incrementally over time until an LP funds the invoice or the invoice expires.

---

## Motivation

Under the current model, a freelancer sets a fixed discount rate when submitting an invoice. If the rate is too low relative to LP appetite, the invoice sits unfunded indefinitely. The freelancer has no recourse except to cancel and resubmit at a higher rate, which costs fees and creates a poor experience.

A Dutch auction solves this by starting at the freelancer's minimum acceptable discount and automatically increasing the rate on a defined schedule. The first LP to call `fund_invoice()` locks in the current rate. This means:

- invoices clear at the market-clearing rate rather than a guessed fixed rate
- freelancers avoid manual resubmission loops
- LPs are incentivised to fund quickly when yield is attractive

---

## Detailed Design

### New invoice fields

```rust
pub struct Invoice {
    // existing fields ...
    pub start_discount_bps: u32,   // starting discount rate in basis points
    pub max_discount_bps: u32,     // ceiling the auction will not exceed
    pub auction_step_bps: u32,     // basis points added per step_interval
    pub step_interval_seconds: u64,// how often the rate increments
    pub submitted_at: u64,         // ledger timestamp of submission
}
```

### Rate calculation

The effective discount at any moment is:

```
elapsed_steps = (now - submitted_at) / step_interval_seconds
current_discount = min(
    start_discount_bps + elapsed_steps * auction_step_bps,
    max_discount_bps
)
```

This is computed inside `fund_invoice()`. No scheduled jobs or oracles are required — the contract is purely reactive.

### Contract changes

- `submit_invoice()` gains four new parameters: `start_discount_bps`, `max_discount_bps`, `auction_step_bps`, `step_interval_seconds`. The existing `discount_bps` parameter is removed.
- `fund_invoice()` reads the current auction rate and deducts it from the freelancer's payout. The LP receives the full invoice amount when the payer settles.
- `get_invoice()` returns the computed `current_discount_bps` alongside the stored fields so the frontend can display a live rate.

### SDK changes

- `submitInvoice()` accepts `auctionParams: { startBps, maxBps, stepBps, intervalSeconds }` instead of `discountBps`.
- A new helper `getCurrentDiscount(invoiceId)` calls `get_invoice()` and returns the live rate.

### CLI changes

```bash
iln submit --payer G... --amount 100 --due 2025-12-31 \
  --start-rate 50 --max-rate 500 --step 10 --interval 3600
```

### Migration

Invoices submitted before this change used the fixed-discount model. They are not affected — the contract stores both models and dispatches on a flag set at submission time. After a deprecation period (suggested: one full testnet cycle), the fixed-discount path can be removed in a follow-up RFC.

### Security considerations

- `max_discount_bps` must be validated at submission to be ≤ some protocol-level ceiling (suggested: 2000 bps / 20%) to prevent griefing.
- `step_interval_seconds` must be ≥ one ledger close time (~5 s) to prevent zero-division.
- The rate calculation uses only on-ledger timestamps, so it is deterministic and manipulation-resistant.

---

## Drawbacks

- More complex submission UX. Freelancers must choose four parameters instead of one. Good defaults will be critical.
- Adds four fields to the `Invoice` struct, increasing storage cost per invoice.
- The migration shim for existing invoices adds contract complexity that must eventually be cleaned up.

---

## Alternatives

**Fixed discount with a retry helper in the SDK** — the SDK could automatically resubmit at a higher rate if an invoice is unfunded after N hours. Rejected because it still requires on-chain cancel/resubmit transactions and gives a worse UX than a native mechanism.

**Off-chain matching engine** — match freelancers and LPs off-chain and settle on-chain. Rejected because it reintroduces a trusted intermediary, which contradicts ILN's permissionless design goal.

**Reverse auction (LP bids down)** — LPs compete by offering lower rates. Rejected for this RFC because it requires multiple LPs to be present simultaneously, which is unlikely at current liquidity levels. Worth revisiting when the LP base grows.

## Unresolved Questions

1. What should the default values for `step_interval_seconds` and `auction_step_bps` be in the SDK to guide freelancers toward reasonable behaviour?
2. Should the protocol enforce a minimum `start_discount_bps` floor to prevent invoices that can never attract LPs?
3. What is the right deprecation timeline for the legacy fixed-discount path?
